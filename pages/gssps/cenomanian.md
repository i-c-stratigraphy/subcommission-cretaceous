## GSSP of the Cenomanian Stage

### Definition
The base of the Cenomanian Stage is defined at 36 meters below the top of the Marnes Bleues Formation on the south side of Mont Risou, east of Rosans, Haute-Alpes, France. This level coincides with the first appearance of the planktonic foraminifer _Rotalipora globotruncanoides_ Sigal, 1948, and can be placed in the context of a series of secondary marker levels based on nannofossils, planktonic foraminifera, ammonites and an ornate δ<sup>13</sup>C curve.

### Location
The GSSP of the Cenomanian Stage is located on the western flanks of Mont Risou (1183m), in NE-SW trending gullies in badlands, 3.15 km east of the center of the town Rosans, Haute-Alpes, France, around a point 5° 30′ 43″E; 44° 23′ 33″N (Lambert II Zone coordinates 852.725; 1937.625) , on the French Série Bleue 1:25,000 Sheet 3239 Ouest, Rosans (Gale _et al_. 1996).

The boundary lies 36m below the top of a thick sequence of constantly eroding marls, the Marnes Bleues of French workers, but can be located in the field in relation to the first limestone that defines the base of the overlying, unnamed unit of limestone-marl alternations.

### Sedimentology
The GSSP succession in the top 136m of the Marnes Bleues Formation is of marls with varying carbonate and organic carbon content. Levels with higher carbonate content weather out as slightly more resistant levels. Levels of higher organic carbon content are frequently laminated, and are again slightly more resisting to weathering. One such level is the Niveau Breistroffer at 124-135m below the first limestone that defines the base of the overlying, unnamed unit of limestone-marl alternations.

### Primary Markers
The base of the Cenomanian corresponds to the first occurrence of the planktonic foraminifer _Rotalipora globotruncanoides_.

Four foraminfer species, _Rotalipora appenninica_, _Rotalipora gandolfii_ (FO at -40m), _Rotalipora globotruncanoides_ (FO at -36m), and _Rotalipora tehamensis_ (FO at -48m) coexist from level -36m to -19m and form a subzonal association that is a useful indicator for the base of the Cenomanian.

### Secondary Markers

**Ammonites**:  
The major faunal change in the ammonite fauna occurs between -30 and -32m, with the disappearance of typical Albian taxa at -32m (_Lechites gaudini_, _Stoliczkaia clavigera_) and the appearance of typical Cenomanian taxa at -30m (_Neostlingoceras oberlini_, _Mantelliceras mantelli_, etc.).

**Nannofossils**:  
First occurrence of _Calculites anfractus_ at -40m.

**Stable Isotopes**:  
The GSSP preserves an excellent δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O record that provides an auxiliary marker.

### Correlation Events
Planktonic foraminifer FAD _Rotalipora globotruncanoides_.

### Notes on Derivation of Age
Spline fit of Ar-Ar ages and ammonite zones, plus monitor standard correction. Then cycle stratigraphy to place foraminifer datum relative to ammonite zonation.
