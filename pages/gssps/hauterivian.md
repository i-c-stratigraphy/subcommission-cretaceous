## GSSP of the Hauterivian Stage

### Definition
The GSSP for the base of the Hauterivian Stage is defined in the La Charce section (Vocontian Basin, southeastern France) at the base of bed number 189 (bed numbering system according to Reboulet et al., 1992).

The base of bed 189 coincides with the First Occurrence (FO) of the ammonite genus _Acanthodiscus_ (species _A. rebouli_), which marks the base of the lowermost Hauterivian _Acanthodiscus radiatus_ ammonite Zone. The FO of _A. radiatus_ lies four beds higher in the succession (bed 193).

### Location
The GSSP section (coordinates: 44°28’10.0″N, 5°26’37.4″E, altitude 620 m) is exposed about 550 m west of La Charce village, about 70 km southeast of Valence and approximately 35 km south of Die in the Department of Drôme, southeastern France. The lower part of the section crops out on the eastern escarpment of the Serre-de-l’Ane (between the electric line and Road D 61) then the section is exposed along the side of the road.

### Sedimentology
The interval of the La Charce section which embraces the Valanginian/Hauterivian boundary is 40 m thick and is included in the “Calcaires marneux à Hoplites” sensu Paquier (1900). It consists of alternated limestone and marly layers that have been interpreted to represent cyclic variations of calcareous nannofossils caused by climatic changes on the Milankovitch scale.

### Primary Marker
The FO of the ammonite genus _Acanthodiscus_, which marks the base of the A. radiatus ammonite Zone at the base of bed number 189 (bed numbering system after Reboulet _et al._, 1992).

### Secondary Markers
Listed below from the stratigraphic top to the bottom (FO = First Occurrence; LO = Last Occurrence)

Bed 217: FO of _Diloma galiciense_ (calcareous nannofossil)  
Bed 214: FO of _Saynella mucronata_ (ammonite)  
Bed 213: LO of _Eiffelithus windii_ and LO of _Tribrachiatus_ sp. (calcareous nannofossils)  
Bed 197: FO of _Leopoldia leopoldina_ (ammonite)  
Bed 194: FO of _Spitidiscus_ (gr. _lorioli-meneghinii_) (ammonite)  
Bed 193: FO of _Breistrofferella castellanensis_ (ammonite)  
Bed 190: FO of _Breistrofferella varapensis_ (ammonite) and FO of _Staurolithites mitcheneri_ (calcareous nannofossil)  
Bed 189: FO of _Teschenites flucticulus_ (ammonite) and FO of _Teschenites pachydicranus_ (ammonite)  
Bed 186: LO of _Teschenites callidiscus_ (ammonite)  

### Correlation Events
The top of Chron M10Nn.3n coincides with the base of the Hauterivian.

Carbon isotopes from carbonate bulk rock samples show a plateau of around 1.3‰ across the Valanginian/Hauterivian boundary.
