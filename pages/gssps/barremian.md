## GSSP of the Barremian Stage

### Definition
The GSSP for the base of the Barremian Stage is defined at the base of bed 171 of the Río Argos section, near Caravaca (SE Spain) and correlated by the first appearance of the ammonite species _Taveraidiscus hugii_.

### Location
The GSSP section is located some 8 km WSW of Caravaca and 1.5 km NW of the small village of Benablón (Region of Murcia, SE Spain), on the southern bank of the river Río Argos. Geographic coordinates of the base of the section are 38º4’13.5”N 1º56’54.3”W, altitude: 771 m.

### Sedimentology and ammonite stratigraphy
The GSSP section is thick, well exposed, and tectonically almost undisturbed. It encompasses the Berriasian–Upper Albian interval, and sedimentation seems continuous with no evidence of interruption or condensation except for a hiatus comprising the Upper Aptian–Middle Albian (van Veen, 1969; Gea, 2004). Sedimentological, palaeontological, taphonomic and palaeoichnological data indicate that the Río Argos succession was deposited in a stable, distal, low-energy, deep-water marine environment.

The lower 8 m of the section (beds 144 to 154; bed numbering of Hoedemaeker and Leereveld (1995), belonging to the _Pseudothurmannia ohmi_ ammonite Subzone (ASz) and most of the _Pseudothurmannia mortilleti_ ASz, consist of a rhythmic alternance of light gray limestone beds (10–75 cm thick) and dark gray marlstone interbeds (10–65 cm thick). A thin laminated black shale interval occurs at the base of the _Pseudothurmannia mortilleti_ ASz (bed 148), which represents the local equivalent of the Faraoni Level (Baudin, 2005; Company et al., 2005; Sauvage et al., 2013; Baudin and Riquier, 2014).
The uppermost part of the _P. mortilleti_ ASz and the _Pseudothurmannia picteti_ ASz (beds 155 to 170b, with a thickness of 15 m) are represented by a predominantly marly interval with yellowish limestone and marly limestone beds (10–45 cm thick) and light grey marlstone layers up to 120 cm thick. 
The following 9 m of the section (beds 171 to 182, _T. hugii_ ASz) correspond to a more regular succession of yellowish limestone beds (10–45 cm thick) and greyish marlstone interbeds (10–60 cm thick).
The uppermost 8 m of the section (beds 183 to 192, _Psilotissotia colombiana_ ASz) are made of thick marlstone layers (up to 100 cm) alternating with thinner marly limestone beds (10–40 cm thick).

Texturally, the sediments composing the lithological successions are mudstones with calcitised radiolarians and scarce foraminifera. The lime fraction is mostly made up of calcareous nannofossil remains (Hoedemaeker and Leereveld, 1995; Gressier, 2010), while clay minerals (illite, smectite, chlorite and kaolinite) are the main components of the detrital fraction (Moiroud et al., 2012). 

### Primary Marker
The first appearance of the ammonite species _Taveraidiscus hugii_ at the base of bed 171 (at 22.8 m from the base of the section).

### Secondary Markers
Listed below from the stratigraphic bottom to the top:
(Abbreviations: FO= First Occurrence; LO= last occurrence; FLE= Faraoni Level Equivalent)

•	Bed 138: FO of the planktonic foraminifera species _Lilliputianella roblesae_ and _Lilliputianella semielongata_. These events mark the base of the _L. semielongata_ Zone.

### Geochronology
According to the astrochronological analysis, the base of the Barremian is dated at 125.77 Ma, and it is separated by a time interval of 0.74 myr from the start of the Faraoni Episode.

### Correlation Events
Further auxiliary marker criteria, with global correlation potential, are provided by non-biostratigraphic methods: 

•	The base of the Barremian correlates with the beginning of a gradual negative trend in the C-isotope curve near bed 170. The trend to lower C-isotope values is preceded by a 10-meter interval with stable C-isotope compositions. The positive C-isotope excursion related to the Faraoni Episode is below the stable interval.

•	Bodin et al. (2009) provide a Sr-isotope value of 0.707470 for the lowermost Barremian in the Angles section.

•	Indirect calibration to the magnetostratigraphic scale suggests that the Hauterivian–Barremian boundary falls in the lowermost part of polarity chron M3r. 

•	The boundary is located in the depositional sequence Ha7, corresponding approximately to the transgressive surface of the sequence. 

•	The cyclostratigraphic analysis indicates a duration of 0.80 myr for the _P. ohmi_ ammonite Zone (AZ) and of 0.56 myr for the _T. hugii_ AZ. The time interval from the start of the Faraoni Episode to the Hauterivian–Barremian boundary is assessed at 0.74 myr. The base of the Barremian Stage is dated at 125.77 Ma.
