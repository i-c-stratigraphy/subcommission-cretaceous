# Barremian GSSP ratified by IUGS

The GSSP proposal to formalize the base of the Barremian Stage defined at the base of bed 171 of the Rio Argos section, near Caravaca (SE Spain) and correlated by the first appearance of the ammonite _Taveraidiscus hugii_ was unanimously approved by the IUGS Executive Committee in March 2023.
