# Berriasian GSSP proposal not approved by the Cretaceous Subcommission - October 2020

The GSSP proposal for the base of the Berriasian Stage at the base of the Calpionellid Alpina Subzone in the Tr√© Maroua section (SE France) was not approved by the Subcommission on Cretaceous Stratigraphy. The Berriasian working group is disbanded following previous practise in ICS and a new working group will be appointed soon.
