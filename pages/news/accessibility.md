# ACCESSIBILITY OF THE SANTONIAN GSSP AT OLAZAGUTIA (NAVARRA, N. SPAIN)

The stratotype section of the Santonian GSSP is located in the Cantera de Margas quarry that belongs to the Cementos Portland Valderribas and is accessible by scientists only upon request to the owner. Therefore, scientists that are willing to visit and sample the GSSP section have to plan their visit in advance and obtain the permission to access the stratotype section through submission of an application form to the Cementos Portland Valderribas.

The application form can be downloaded *[here](files/Form_Santonian_GSSP.pdf) and must be sent to Ana Hern√°ndez Artigas (<ana.hernandez@gcpv.com>), reference person of the Cementos Portland Valderribas.
