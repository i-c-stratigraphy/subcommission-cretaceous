**August 27 -September 4, 2016** – 35th IGC Business Meeting of the Subcommission on Cretaceous Stratigraphy

Dear Voting Members and Task Groups officers of the Subcommission on Cretaceous Stratigraphy

In my role of incoming chair of the Subcommission at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa (27 August-4 September 2016), it is my pleasure to invite you at the Business Meeting of the Subcommission on Cretaceous Stratigraphy scheduled for 30 August at 18.00.

The complete schedule of the ICS Business Meeting and its Subcommissions is available on the website of the 35th IGC (<http://www.35igc.org/Verso/221/Business-Meetings>)

If you attend the 35th IGC please confirm your participation at the Cretaceous Business Meeting.

Here is the preliminary agenda. If anyone wishes to introduce a subject item for discussion, please let me known and it will be added to the agenda.

– Presentation of the new officers.
– Current status of Cretaceous GSSPs.
– Objectives and work plan for the 2016-2020 term.
– Meeting themes/session topics for the 10th International Symposium on the Cretaceous, Vienna 21-26 August 2017.

In order to prepare the work plan for the submission of the remaining GSSPs proposals, I kindly ask the Task Groups officers to send me an update on the current status of the GSSPs proposals. For your convenience I attach the Annual Report 2015 of the Cretaceous Subcommission submitted by the past chair Malcolm Hart to ICS.

Voting members and Task Groups officers who will not be able to attend the meeting in Cape Town are kindly requested to communicate if they are willing to renew their memberships and actively participate into the Subcommission for the next 4 years.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the past chair Malcolm Hart for his dedication over the past 4 years in the Subcommission activities. Thanks also go to the past vice chair Brian Huber for his efforts into the Subcommission objectives and to the past secretary Bruno Granier for having taking care of the Subcommission topics including the website maintenance (<http://paleopolis.rediris.es/ISCS/>).

Thanks to all of you for your work and support.

Looking forward to seeing you all in Cape Town or in Vienna next summer.

Best regards,

Maria Rose Petrizzo
ISCS Chair
